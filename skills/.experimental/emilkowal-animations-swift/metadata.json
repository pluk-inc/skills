  "abstract": "Comprehensive animation guide for SwiftUI and AppKit interfaces, adapted from Emil Kowalski's web animation principles and Framer Motion best practices. Contains 80 rules across 10 categories targeting iOS 17+, prioritized by impact from critical (easing selection, timing) to polish (phase animators, keyframe sequences). Each rule includes detailed explanations, production-realistic Swift code examples comparing incorrect vs. correct implementations, and specific values to guide animation decisions.",
